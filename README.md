# My4thEmu
Quick hack of an emulator for Dennis Kuschel's My4TH computer.
No I/O emulation so far.

More information about My4TH can be found at
http://mynor.org/my4th.htm

The files rom.bin and rom.lst are taken from Dennis' My4TH sources
(http://mynor.org/downloads/my4th-rom-v1.2.zip) and are licensed 
under Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0. 

The rom.lst file is used for a horrible disassembly hack - make sure
to keep it consistent with the rom.bin file to obtain useful output...
